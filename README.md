parse-friends-ios
=================

This "app" was built to show you how to add and remove friend relationships, for both the currently logged in user
and the friend being added, when using Parse.com as a BaaS.

This app is not really a fully functioning app at all. You should not try to build and run this app. 

It was built as a quick example to show how you can implement the special friend relationship functionality that is made
possible by using my custom Parse Cloud Code file. This file can be found in my [friends-relation-parse-cloud-code repo](https://github.com/mitchellporter/friends-relation-parse-cloud-code).

Simply download this repo, open the project in `Xcode`, and view the `MPViewController.m` file.

Pragma marks and comments have been added to easily explain what is going on in the code.
